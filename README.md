## About
SpikeGUI is an extracellular spike analysis software with graphical user interface. The main aim of this software is to correlate spike times with various stimuli and behavouiral variables, including vestibular and visual stimulation and eye movement. Spike times are generated using [KiloSort](https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort) and [KiloSort2](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort), pupil positions using [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut), and open-field analysis of spatial behaviour using [opendirection](https://github.com/adamltyson/opendirection). 

This pipeline is written by Richard Faville in close collaboration with Sepiedeh Keshavarzi and is funded by the [Margrie lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab) at [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/). 
probez and rotation-analysis packages are written by [Stephen Lenzi](https://github.com/stephenlenzi). 
vest_phys and pyphys packages are written by Charly Rousseau. 
margrie_libs package is written by Charly Rousseau with contribution from Stephen Lenzi.
